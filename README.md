# ðŸŽµ Audio Visualizer
# Project Overview
Audio Visualizer is a web-based application that transforms real-time sound into captivating visual animations. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project processes audio input from a microphone and generates dynamic visual effects that react to sound properties such as frequency and amplitude.

The project was developed as a creative fusion of programming and music, demonstrating how technology can enhance artistic expression.

# Features
- Real-Time Audio Processing â€“ Captures live audio through the deviceâ€™s microphone and converts it into animated visuals.
- Customizable Visuals â€“ Users can adjust color schemes, object sizes, and other display settings.
- Interactive Environment â€“ Includes features like a color picker, "Party Mode" with animated effects, and a built-in Spotify playlist integration.
- Canvas-Based Animation â€“ Uses HTML5 Canvas API to render fluid and responsive visual effects.
- Optimized Performance â€“ Implements efficient JavaScript rendering techniques for smooth animations.
# Interactive Features
Color Picker: Customize the animationâ€™s colors.
Object Scaling: Adjust the size of animated elements.
Party Mode: Special effects with flashing lights and dynamic transitions.
Spotify Playlist Integration: Play curated music alongside visual effects.
# Technologies Used
JavaScript â€“ Core logic for audio processing and visualization.
HTML5 & CSS3 â€“ Structured layout and styling.
Canvas API â€“ Dynamic graphics rendering.
# How It Works
The application requests microphone access and captures incoming audio.
Audio data is processed and analyzed in real time.
The system visualizes the sound waves as animated bouncing objects.
Users can modify the visual appearance using interactive controls.
#Future Enhancements
Support for external audio files.
Additional visualization styles (bars, waves, particles).
Advanced user customization options.
This project was a valuable learning experience in real-time data visualization and creative coding. Full documentation for now in Slovak - search for pdf "dokumentacia.pdf".
